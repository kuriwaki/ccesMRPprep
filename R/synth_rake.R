#' Model synthetic joint distribution with simple product
#'
#' Estimates joint distribution by simply assuming independence and multiplying
#' proportions.
#'
#' @details That is, we already know `p(X_{1}, ..., X_{K - 1}, A)` from `poptable`
#'  and a marginal `p(X_{K}, A)`from the additional distribution to weight to. Then
#'  `p(X_{1}, .., X_{K - 1}, X_{K}, A) = p(X_{1}, ..., X_{K - 1}, A) x p(X_{K}, A)`.
#'
#' @inheritParams synth_mlogit
#' @param newtable A dataset that contains marginal counts or proportions. Will be
#'  collapsed internally to get simple proportions.
#'
#' @seealso `synth_mlogit()` for a more nuanced model that uses survey data as
#'  the basis of the joint estimation.
