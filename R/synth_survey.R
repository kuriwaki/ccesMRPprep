#' Model synthetic joint distribution with multinomial logit
#'
#' Imputes the counts of a joint distribution of count variables for small areas
#' based on microdata. `synth_smoothfix()` is basically `synth_mlogit()()` which is then corrected by
#' if one knows the marginals.See Details.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' In this setup, the population distribution table (`poptable`)
#' has the joint distribution of `(A, X_{1}, ..., X_{K - 1})` categorical variables where
#' `A` denotes a categorical small area, `X`s denote categorical covariates, and
#' the missing covariate is `X_{K}`.
#'
#' Now, the survey data (`microdata`) has a sample joint distribution of
#' `(X_{1}, .., X_{K - 1}, X_{K})` categorical variables but the sample size is too small
#' for small areas. Therefore, the function models a multinomial outcome model roughly of the
#' form `X_{K} ~ X_{1} + ... X_{K}` and predicts onto `poptable` to estimate the
#' joint distribution of `(A, X_{1}, .., X_{K})`
#'
#' Currently, this function does not support post-stratifiation based on a known aggregate
#' distribution -- that is, further adjusting the probabilities based on
#' a known population distribution (see e.g. Leeman and Wasserfallen AJPS <https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12319>)
#'
#' @param formula A representation of the aggregate imputation or "outcome" model,
#'  of the form `X_{K} ~ X_1 + ... X_{K - 1}`
#' @param microdata The survey table that the multinomial model will be built off.
#'  Must contain all variables in the LHS and RHS of `formula`.
#' @param poptable The population table, collapsed in terms of counts. Must contain
#'  all variables in the RHS of `formula`, as well as the variables specified in
#'   `area_var` and `count_var` below.
#' @param area_var A character vector of the area of interest.
#' @param count_var A character variable that specifies which variable in `poptable`
#'  indicates the count
#'
#' @returns A dataframe with a similar format as the `poptarget` table
#'  but with rows expanded to serve as a joint distribution. In general,
#'  if the variable of interest has `L` values, the final dataset will have
#'  `L` times more rows than `poptarget`. The data will have additional variables:
#'
#'  * The outcome variable of interest (`Z`). For example if the LHS of the formula
#'     was `party_id`, then there would be a column called `party_id` containing the
#'     values of that variable in long form.
#'  * `prX`: The known distribution of the covriates (RHS) within the area, i.e.
#'     `Pr(X | A)`.
#'  * `prZ_givenX`: The main estimate from the multinomial logit model. Formally,
#'     `Pr(Z | X, A)`, although this is usually the same value for every `A`
#'     and thus equal to `Pr(Z | X)` unless `A` is on the RHS as well.
#'  * `prXZ`: A new estimate for the joint distribution within the area, i.e.
#'     `Pr(Z, X | A)`. Computed by `prX * prZ_givenX`.
#'  * `count`: A new count variable. Simply the product of `n_aggregate` and `pr_pred`.
