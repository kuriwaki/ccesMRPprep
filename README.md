## Functions to Clean and Prepare CCES data for MRP

This provides data loading, processing, and formatting functions for a
particular task: using CCES data for Multilevel Regression
Post-stratification. Model fitting and visualization of MRP itself is
handled elsewhere. This package is focused on the preparation to get
there.

  - <https://github.com/kuriwaki/rcces> has another set of CCES related
    functions, but these are either my own personal functions in
    development (not for production), or specific to non-MRP projects.
  - <https://github.com/kuriwaki/CCES_district-opinion> is a private
    package that uses (among others) this package to process large CCES
    data for MRP at scale.
