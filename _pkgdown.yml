  title: Portable Routines for Preparing CCES and ACS data for MRP
  description: >
    Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) is a method for analyzing
    surveys, and can be implemented on public datasets such as the CCES, ACS, and CPS.
    This package provides data loading, processing, and formatting functions for
    a particular task: using CCES data for MRP. It uses the dataverse and
    tidycensus packages to load data and provide some crosswalks. Model fitting
    and visualization of MRP itself is handled elsewhere.
