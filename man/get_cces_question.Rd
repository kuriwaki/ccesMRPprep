\title{Get one column of outcome questions for each model}
\usage{
get_cces_question(qcode, year, qID, data_dir = "data/input/cces")
}
\arguments{
\item{qcode}{A string, the variable name of the outcome variable of interest,
exactly as it appears in the CCES dataset. Together with \code{year}, uniquely identifies
the outcome question data}

\item{year}{A string for the year the question was asked, which will correspond
to the dataset. If using a dataset from the cumulative, set to \code{"cumulative"}.
Together with \code{qcode}, uniquely identifies the outcome question data}

\item{qID}{A string, the user's unique name for the question. For example, we use the
syntax in our question table.}

\item{data_dir}{A path for the directory where flat files for the CCES common content is
stored.  Currently the data must be of the form \verb{cces_\{year\}.rds}  in that directory
to be read in. For a general script that uses \link{get_cces_dv}, see
\url{https://github.com/kuriwaki/CCES_district-opinion/blob/master/R/initialize-cces-downloads.R}
which is still private.}
}
\value{
A three-column dataframe with the columns
\describe{
\item{year}{The year}
\item{case_id}{The respondent identifier within year}
\item{qID}{The question ID}
\item{response}{The outcome question, of class factor}
}
The object will also have an attribute called \code{question}, which will save
the question identifier \code{qID}
}

\details{
This transformation currently only supports Yes/No questions. For some common
ordinal questions that ca n be, with manual recodes, be set to a Yes/No question,
there is some hard-coding of the recode in the question. In the future, this should be
defined outside of the function in a taxanomy.
