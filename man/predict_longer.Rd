\usage{
predict_longer(
  fit,
  poptable,
  microdata,
  X_form,
  X_vars,
  area_var,
  count_var,
  outcome_var
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A model of class bmlogit/emlogit}

\item{poptable}{The population table, collapsed in terms of counts. Must contain
all variables in the RHS of \code{formula}, as well as the variables specified in
\code{area_var} and \code{count_var} below.}

\item{X_vars}{A character vector of the variables to keep. By design, this
should be fewer variables than what is available in \code{poptable}.}

\item{area_var}{A character vector of the area of interest.}

\item{count_var}{A character variable that specifies which variable in \code{poptable}
indicates the count}

\item{outcome_names}{A character vector of names that correspond to each level
of the outcome of the multinomial. Must be manually set to the same ordering as
the fitted objects.}

Tidy joint probabilities

\details{
Internal function to predict from a emlogit/bmlogit object, then reshape to
the population of interest. See \code{synth_mlogit()} and \code{synth_bmlogit()}
